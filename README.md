# child_nutrition_calculator
Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of a childcare provider. As a childcare provider, we have an essential role in children’s lives by helping them learn and grow. You help children get the nourishment and energy they need to learn and grow by providing healthy meals. Also, preschoolers who eat a variety of healthy foods and play actively several times every day are less likely to be overweight or obese.    Keeping all this in mind I created small project 🎯  CHILD NUTRITION CALCULATOR👨‍⚕️ using python.    📍The calculator takes the necessary information of the child :  such as (name, age, height, weight) and calculates the BMI and gives the information weather the child is (underweight, normal or overweight.)    📍Again it takes the information of what child has eaten throughout the day and in what quantities and calculates the daily calorie consumption of child providing weather the child is properly nourished or not
